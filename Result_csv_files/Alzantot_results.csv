"I love sci-fi and am [[willing]] to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood.

"Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This one features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is [[entertaining]] and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but hardly profound. Many of the characters are [[heavily]] stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy [[tough]] lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s. All passably acted but again [[nothing]] special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very [[simplistic]], but then you weren't expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.","Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies.

"its a [[totally]] average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the [[end]] plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer [[guessing]] and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the [[flask]] backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not [[really]] worth watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the [[film]] are of poor directed quality","its a [[absolutely]] average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the [[ending]] plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer [[suppose]] and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the [[balloon]] backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not [[truly]] worth watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the [[cinema]] are of poor directed quality",0.0037667155265808105,0.7666316032409668,0,1,0,1271,"Successful"

"First off let me say, If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans. It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme) or In hell but, in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run. Good fun stuff!","First off let me say, If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport, you probably will not like this movie.
