# Adversarial Robustness Enhancement for Sentiment Analysis Models

This project investigates and improves the adversarial robustness of BERT-based sentiment analysis models through comprehensive attack evaluation and defensive training techniques.

##TL;DR

Built a BERT sentiment classifier that maintains 86% clean accuracy and 56% adversarial robustness through enhanced training and calibration.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two main components:
1. [**Adversarial Attack Analysis**](https://github.com/k-dickinson/model_attacks_and_robustness/blob/main/notebooks/Final_imdb_Model_Attacks.ipynb) - Comprehensive evaluation of model vulnerabilities
2. [**Robustness Enhancement**](https://github.com/k-dickinson/model_attacks_and_robustness/blob/main/notebooks/Final_imdb_model_improved_robustness.ipynb) - Defensive training and model improvements

## Part 1: Adversarial Attack Analysis

### Methodology

We evaluate the robustness of a pre-trained BERT model (`textattack/bert-base-uncased-imdb`) against four state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods using the TextAttack framework.

#### Attack Methods Evaluated

| Attack Method | Description | Key Characteristics |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **TextFooler** (Jin et al., 2019) | Word-level substitution using semantic similarity | High semantic preservation, synonym-based |
| **DeepWordBug** (Gao et al., 2018) | Character-level perturbations | Typo-based attacks, minimal visual changes |
| **PWWS** (Ren et al., 2019) | Word substitution with saliency ranking | Prioritizes important words for substitution |
| **BAE** (Garg & Ramakrishnan, 2019) | BERT-based adversarial examples | Context-aware substitutions using BERT |

#### Evaluation Metrics

We assess attack effectiveness across multiple dimensions:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of examples where the attack successfully flipped the model's prediction
- **Perturbation Efficiency**: Average number of words modified per successful attack
- **Semantic Preservation**: Cosine similarity between original and perturbed text embeddings using SentenceTransformers
- **Fluency**: Perplexity scores using GPT-2 to measure text naturalness

#### Experimental Setup

- **Dataset**: IMDB movie review test set
- **Sample Size**: 20 examples per attack method (expandable for full evaluation)
- **Reproducibility**: Fixed random seed (42) across all experiments
- **Hardware**: CUDA-enabled GPU support with fallback to CPU

#### Key Findings

<img src="https://github.com/k-dickinson/model_attacks_and_robustness/blob/main/visuals/model_attack_results.png" alt="model attacks" width="500">

The analysis revealed significant vulnerabilities in the baseline BERT model across all attack methods. Based on the comprehensive evaluation metrics, **BAE (BERT-based Adversarial Examples)** was selected as the primary attack method for subsequent robustness training due to its:

- High attack success rate
- Context-aware perturbations that maintain semantic meaning
- Realistic adversarial examples that could occur in real-world scenarios
- Strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics

#### Quality Assurance Measures

- **Semantic Similarity**: Ensuring adversarial examples maintain semantic meaning using sentence embeddings
- **Fluency Assessment**: GPT-2 based perplexity scoring to validate text naturalness
- **Perturbation Analysis**: Tracking the minimal number of changes required for successful attacks

### Results Structure

All attack results are systematically logged and saved as CSV files for detailed analysis:
- Individual attack logs with success/failure annotations
- Perturbation statistics and modification counts  
- Original vs. perturbed text comparisons
- Confidence score distributions

## Part 2: Robustness Enhancement and Model Improvement

### Training Data Enhancement Strategy

Based on the adversarial attack analysis, we implemented a comprehensive training enhancement pipeline to improve model robustness across multiple dimensions.

#### Enhanced Training Dataset Composition

Our training approach combines multiple data sources for maximum robustness:

- **Clean IMDB Data**: 4,000 balanced samples (2,000 per class) as the foundation
- **Adversarial Examples**: Successful BAE attack samples integrated at 20% maximum ratio to prevent overfitting
- **Negation-Aware Data**: 120 custom examples targeting double negatives and subtle sentiment patterns
- **Quality Filtering**: Comprehensive text validation including length constraints and corruption detection

#### Advanced Training Configuration

| Component | Configuration | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Class Weighting** | Balanced weights computed from training distribution | Handles any remaining data imbalance |
| **Learning Rate** | 2e-5 with cosine scheduling | Conservative approach with gradual decay |
| **Regularization** | Label smoothing (0.1) + Weight decay (0.01) | Prevents overfitting to adversarial patterns |
| **Early Stopping** | 3-epoch patience on F1 score | Optimal model selection |
| **Mixed Precision** | FP16 training enabled | Improved training efficiency |

### Model Calibration Enhancement

#### Temperature Scaling Implementation

To address model overconfidence, we implemented an enhanced temperature scaling approach:

- **Adaptive Temperature**: Optimized using validation set with regularization
- **Confidence Reduction**: Systematic reduction of overconfident predictions
- **Calibration Improvement**: Significant reduction in Expected Calibration Error

The temperature scaling process resulted in:
